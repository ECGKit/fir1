An efficient finite impulse response (FIR) filter class in C++ and Python wrapper.

The FIR filter class offers also adaptive filtering using the least mean square (LMS) or normalised least mean square (NLMS) algorithm.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Installation}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}

\DoxyCodeLine{The above plot shows the filter in action which removes 50Hz noise with the adaptive}
\DoxyCodeLine{filter. Learning is very fast and the learning rate here is deliberately kept low to}
\DoxyCodeLine{show how it works.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#\#\# Stability}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{The FIR filter itself is stable but the error signal changes the filter coefficients which}
\DoxyCodeLine{in turn change the error and so on. There is a rule of thumb that the learning rate}
\DoxyCodeLine{should be less than the "{}tap power"{} of the input signal which is just the sum of all}
\DoxyCodeLine{squared values held in the different taps:}

\end{DoxyCode}
 learning\+\_\+rate $<$ 1/get\+Tap\+Input\+Power() \`{}\`{}\`{} That allows an adaptive learning rate which is called \char`\"{}normalised LMS\char`\"{}. From my experiments that works in theory but in practise the realtime value of get\+Tap\+Input\+Power() can make the algorithm easily unstable because it might suggest infinite learning rates and can fluctuate wildly. A better approach is to keep the learning rate constant and rather control the power of the input signal by, for example, normalising the input signal or limiting it.

See the demo below which removes 50Hz from an ECG which uses a normalised 50Hz signal which guarantees stability by design.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxyparagraph{Python}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
The commands under JAVA and Python are identical to C++.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Demos}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
Demo programs are in the \char`\"{}demo\char`\"{} directory which show how to use the filter.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily firdemo} sends an impulse into the filter and you should see the impulse response at its output.
\item {\ttfamily lmsdemo} filters out 50Hz noise from an ECG with the help of adaptive filtering by using the 50Hz powerline frequency as the input to the filter. This can be replaced by any reference artefact signal or signal which is correlated with the artefact.
\item filter\+\_\+ecg.\+py performs the filtering of an ECG in python using the fir1 python module which in turn calls internally the C++ functions.
